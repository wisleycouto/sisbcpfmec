## Development server

It is used to speed up setup when developping a project using React with npm. It prepares a container with latest versions of:

node
npm
WebPack
React
EsLint
a good deal of node modules pre-installed.
Environments
It bootstraps an application with three environments:

dev, an environment to develop on a local machine, hot reload components, etc.
dist, an environment releasing only the code that is used packaged for distribution.
test, an environment to run automated tests.
Do not use this image for production, you should compile your React anyway and only push the result of the dist folder when running npm run dist.

Dev
The default environment is dev and this image provides a server (started by the default command npm start) that serves from port 80. As with all Docker containers we suggest you do some port forwarding when creating an image (docker run -p 3000:80).

Setup and configuration
Use it as a base and mount or copy your actual application to /usr/app.

The webpack configurations are in /usr/app/cfg/ (base.js, dev.js, â€¦). To modify those configs you need to overwrite them by copying a new file on top of it.

The actual source of the app should be mounted in /usr/app/src, more specifically the webpack entrypoint for the app is taken by default from /usr/app/src/entry.js or /usr/app/src/entry.jsx.

Local testing
To test this image locally before publishing, build it with

docker build -t bayesimpact/react-base:latest .

Then simply rebuild your images that are based on react-base.

Continuous integration
When running the CI on a branch, CircleCI builds the docker image. On the master branch, it will also run a job in each dependant repos. To add a new repo, do the following:

Configure your repo's build
Add a job test-for-base-change that runs your tests that depends on the version of the bayesimpact/react-base docker image.

This job must use the REACT_BASE_TAG environment variable as the docker image tag.

Using REACT_BASE_TAG (required)
If you build an image on top of bayesimpact/react-base, just replace your FROM command with

ARG REACT_BASE_TAG
FROM bayesimpact/react-base:${REACT_BASE_TAG:-latest}
And run docker build --build-arg REACT_BASE_TAG <your_usual_build>.

You can also do this using docker-compose. In your docker-compose.yml:

service_name:
    ...
    build:
      ...
      args:
        ...
        - REACT_BASE_TAG
And then run docker-compose build service_name

Using Github Status (optional)
To tell docker-react that the build succeeded on the dependant repo, you must update a Github status check on docker-react. This is completely optional (the corresponding check will remain "pending" if you don't do it, but it's not blocking anything).

Once the dependant repo considers the build successful, it should call the status check API with the following HTTPS request:

curl -u "$GITHUB_STATUS_TOKEN" "$STATUS_UPDATE_URL" \
  -XPOST --data '{"status": "success", "context": "'$STATUS_CONTEXT'"}'
GITHUB_STATUS_TOKEN should be given as basic authentication with a Github access token, with repo:status access on bayesimpact/docker-react. The other environment variables (STATUS_UPDATE_URL and STATUS_CONTEXT) are directly given to the dependent repo CircleCI build.

Configuring docker-react build
Add a job in the commit workflow

- check-dependant-repo:
    requires:
      - build
    repo: <your_repo_name>
    owner: <your_repo_owner> # not needed if it's bayesimpact
Publishing the image
The public image on https://hub.docker.com/r/bayesimpact/react-base/ gets updated automatically. You just have to edit the Dockerfile and push to github. Always have someone review your code before you push to master.
